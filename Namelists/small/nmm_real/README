===============================
NON-NESTED NMM REGRESSION TESTS
===============================


Most of these namelist files come from the DTC, and their naming conventions are followed here.
Some of the tests are machine-specific and not general, so we place them in the UNUSED/ directory.

File namelist.input.15 is a test taken from Dave Gill, where the domain and time_control parameters
were modified to match the settings for the other namelist files.
